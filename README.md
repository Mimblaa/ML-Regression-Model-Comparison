# ML Regression Model Comparison
This project focuses on comparing multiple machine learning models for regression tasks. The goal is to evaluate and analyze the performance of various regression algorithms, including Ridge Regression, Lasso Regression, Support Vector Machines (SVM), and Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP).

Key features of the project include:

Data preprocessing, including scaling and noise addition for robust model evaluation.
Hyperparameter tuning using Grid Search to optimize model performance.
In-depth analysis of model accuracy and evaluation metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE) and RÂ² score.
Investigation of the impact of adding noise to the target variable and its effect on model performance.
Detailed comparison of results for multiple regression techniques.
This repository provides a comprehensive approach to regression model comparison. It is useful for anyone looking to understand the strengths and weaknesses of different machine learning regression algorithms in the presence of noisy data.
